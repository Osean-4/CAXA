Description: The package contains three functions that clean the data of any unwanted experiments. Firstly, data containing trials of the species White-rumped shama and Zebra dove are removed due to low sampling effort. Secondly, data containing trials not equal to 15 minutes are removed due to low sampling effort. Lastly, a generalized linear mixed model is applied to the data.
